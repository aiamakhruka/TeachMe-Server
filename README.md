# Teach Me

My project is focused on developing a user-friendly website that connects students with experienced teachers for personalized subject tutoring. The platform will make it easy for students to find qualified teachers who can help them with specific subjects they are interested in. Whether it's math, science, language, or any other subject, the platform will match students with the right teachers who can provide one-on-one guidance and support. The goal is to create a convenient and effective way for students to receive personalized help and enhance their learning experience.




## Features

-Advanced Filtering: Students can easily find teachers by applying multiple filters based on preferences and factors such as subject, availability,location, and expertise.

-Booking, Reviews, and Ratings: Students can book teachers, leave reviews, and provide ratings to help others make informed choices.

-Teacher Registration and Service Provision: Teachers can register, create profiles, and offer their services, managing availability and rates for different teaching formats.


## Coming soon

Real-time Communication: The platform will facilitate seamless communication between students and teachers through a built-in messaging system. This feature enables students to ask questions, seek clarification, and receive timely feedback from their teachers. It promotes interactive and effective learning interactions.
